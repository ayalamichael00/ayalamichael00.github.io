When a Kik user first sends the Colts a message, they start a journey from dreaming about playing in the pros to taking to the field in front of tens of thousands of fans.</p> <p dir="ltr">This journey is brought to life through the power of chat with an episodic and interactive story. The chat takes users through distinct developmental stages in an athlete’s life, from college to combine to the draft, and then training camp. Kik users can choose their own adventures by making key decisions that impact where the story goes. If they make the right choices, they’ll find out what it’s like to make it to the pros.</p> <p dir="ltr">Soon, fans will also be able to chat with Colts tight-end Coby Fleener during a Q&amp;A about what it’s like to play in the NFL.</p> <p dir="ltr">Interactions between pro sports teams and their fans are being reimagined through chat. The Colts are one of the first, but there’ll be more to come.</p>

Codes, as I affectionately refer to it, has a special place in my heart. Why? I designed it. The funny thing is, I’m just a student. I, along with 26 other students, work at Kik to help create awesome products to ship to our users. We are mentored by Kik’s full-time employees every day to develop our skills as we work in their fast-paced, high-intensity culture.</p> <p id="e51c">So why on earth did a company like Kik leave the UI/UX design decisions of such an important feature to some kid from the University of Waterloo? It’s called the co-op program, and let me tell you, it’s something special.</p> <p id="8b4e">Co-op is essentially a full time, paid internship for students in any area of academia to apply their knowledge to projects in the work place. I’m studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. In my five-year program, I have six four-month co-op placements at any company, in any field, and in any position I am interested in (granted that I land the job in the first place).</p> <p id="4a9a">When I was first given the Kik Codes project, all that had been designed was the code itself (which, by the way, was <em>also</em> done by a co-op student from UW). Over the last four months, I have invested countless hours into making this feature useful and beautiful for Kik users. I’ve created wireframes, conducted UX research, user tested, designed interfaces, animations, interactions, and much more. I was the only designer on Kik Codes, meaning I had full creative reign over every design decision. This kind of responsibility and ownership is huge for a student; it gave me a chance to learn what it’s like to be a lead designer on a major product feature at just 20 years old.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kik-Codes-iPhone.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5244" title="Kik Codes iPhone" src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kik-Codes-iPhone.png" alt="" width="560" height="340" /></a></p> <p id="4353">This was actually my second term at Kik. I had originally made a promise to myself that I would never repeat a co-op placement. The way I saw it, I had six terms to try six different things. But then I started working at Kik. It was my first design job ever, but right from the start, my mentors were incredibly supportive; they knew my skill level and were devoted to helping me learn. In my first term, I independently redesigned Kik Points, a digital rewards program. While working on Points, I learned what it’s like to be a real designer; I did everything from wire-framing to pixel-pushing, and worked with an awesome team of developers to make my ideas a reality.</p> <p id="c3d3">When my first term at Kik was over, I was faced with a choice: take my newfound skills to another company, or return to Kik for another four months. This was not an easy decision for me, but after much deliberation on a professional and personal level, I chose to return to Kik for three reasons:</p> <h4 id="5965"><strong>1. The People</strong></h4> <p id="3d47">Kik is a 100-person company, about a quarter of which are co-ops. That means a significant portion of the staff changes every four months. This doesn’t stop the team from getting to know the co-ops; in fact, it encourages them to forge meaningful bonds with their students to make sure both parties have the best possible experience. We may go on some pretty cool off-sites (the last one involved axe-throwing), but sometimes we just kick back on Friday nights with a beer or two and hang out in the office. I made so many good friends in my first term that I was tempted to return just to work with them again.</p> <h4 id="90ac"><strong>2. The Mentorship</strong></h4> <p id="42c3">I learned so much in my first co-op term at Kik. Beyond the mentorship I received in design, I got to learn about web development, data analysis, and marketing through interacting with other team members. Everyone at Kik is willing to teach you something if you are willing to learn.</p> <h4 id="3b40"><strong>3. The Project</strong></h4> <p id="00f2">When I was told I would be working on Codes if I were to return to Kik, I was definitely intrigued. I had never worked on a project of such magnitude, or that would be used by so many people (Kik has more than 240 million registered users). I couldn’t shake the feeling that this project would be a pivotal moment in my career, and my ticket into the professional design community. It’s not every day a company entrusts a student with a project like this, and I didn’t want to give up such a unique opportunity.</p> <p id="365c">It’s crazy to think Kik puts so much trust in its co-op students, but a big part of why they do is because we <em>are </em>students. We’re only at the company for four months, so we have a unique perspective when it comes to the products Kik creates. One of the reasons Kik cares so much about the co-op program is that many of its employees started off as co-ops themselves. Because of their background, the team has a profound understanding of the value of this style of education, for both the company and the students.</p> <p id="9d5a">I credit so much of my design knowledge and skill to working at Kik, and am so thankful for the time I got to spend there. It has been an incredible eight-month journey, full of hard work, good friends and great memories. Being the designer on Kik Codes has been an amazing foundation for my career in design, and I can’t wait to apply my skills to the next project that comes my way!</p> <p>- Katherine Carras, Systems Design Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo</p>

It’s a way to blow off creative steam and try out new ideas. Past Hack Weeks have produced new features for Kik or prompted ideas for future products.</p> <p>This Hack Week, we had about a dozen of our partners fly to Waterloo to build with us for the week. The frenzy of activity saw the creation of a wide range of fun and useful new bots. We saw bots that help you find places to eat, or buy new outfits. There were bots that helped you save data, and bots that made GIFs easy to create and share. One of the most popular bots was a game that let you claim a specific area of the office to gain points. You could then use Kik Points to lock, unlock or steal your friend’s space. The office got a little crazy with this game – 72 of us ended up playing!</p> <p>Check out some photos from the week in the slideshow below.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div id="gslideshow" class="gss-container no-captions"> <div class="cycle-slideshow" data-cycle-timeout="0" data-cycle-prev="#gslideshow_prev" data-cycle-next="#gslideshow_next" data-cycle-pager="#gslideshow_pager" data-cycle-pager-template="<a href=#>&nbsp;</a>" data-cycle-speed="750" data-cycle-center-horz="true" > <img src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hack-week-S152.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hack-week-s153.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hackweek-s154.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hack-week-s155.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hackweek-s156.jpg" alt="" /> </div> <div class="gss-info"> <div class="gss-nav"><div id="gslideshow_prev" class="gss-prev">&lt;</div><div id="gslideshow_next" class="gss-next">&gt;</div></div> <div id="gslideshow_pager" class="gss-pager"></div> </div> </div>

At first I was hesitant. I was confident we could win the race alone. But, keeping in line with Kik’s principle of considering all the options, I eventually agreed to take a look.</p> <p>I made a list of every major company we could partner with. Some were tech companies, some were content companies. Some were in the U.S., some were in Asia. Then, beside each company, I wrote two hypothetical stories with imagined outcomes about what we accomplished together in the first year, in both dream and nightmare scenarios. From these stories, I extracted a list of pros and cons and used them to prioritize the options.</p> <p>Right from the start, Tencent was at the top of the list. As the maker of QQ and WeChat, it was clear they understood chat deeply, making them a great sounding board. They had significant success and resources, allowing them to have the patience required for Kik to pursue a long-term vision for a chat-based ecosystem. And with so much of their focus on winning China, they would support Kik running independently to win the U.S.</p> <p>It wasn’t until we spent time with Tencent in China, however, that we became sure they would be the best partner.</p> <p>At Kik, we believe chat will be the simplest way to connect with the world around you. Chat is already the simplest and most frequent way we connect with our friends and family. It can be both synchronous and asynchronous, and it’s always with us. What if that simplicity could be applied to other things we want to connect with?</p> <p>That’s what we saw in China.</p> <p>Want to get a soda from a vending machine? You can use WeChat to scan the machine to start chatting and get the menu sent to you instantly. Then you can select the item, agree to pay through the app, and get your drink.</p> <p>Want to print a picture? Scan the printer to start chatting, send it a picture, and the picture comes out.</p> <p>Want 10 percent off a T-shirt? Scan the checkout to start chatting, complete a survey, and get the coupon sent to you.</p> <p>There’s nothing new to download, nothing new to learn, and nothing new to remember. Just scan, then chat. The chat app became a magic wand that empowered you to seamlessly interact with the world around you.</p> <p>That has always been our vision. But Tencent had already made it real.</p> <p>When we met the Tencent team in China, it became clear that we had a shared vision. We agreed that someone would do in the West what WeChat was doing in China. The only question was who. We both believe it could be Kik.</p> <p>Today, there are only five other companies in the world that see the future like we do: Tencent, Line, Facebook, Snapchat, and Telegram. One of them owns the largest internet market in the world. We couldn’t be more excited to partner with them as we run this race.</p> <p>- Ted, Founder and CEO</p>

Jam is a service that keeps you up-to-date with your favorite artists, and lets you find new friends who like the same music as you.</p> <p>Not sure which artist to search for first? Here are five we think you should definitely check out.</p> <p><strong>1. The Weeknd</strong></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Weeknd1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5140" title="The-Weeknd" src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Weeknd1.png" alt="" width="350" height="622" /></a></p> <p>From “I Can’t Feel My Face” to “The Hills,” The Weeknd has been a big part of the soundtrack to our summer. Check him out on Jam for concert tickets (he’s currently touring the U.S.) and to find other fans to chat with.</p> <p><strong>2. Fifth Harmony</strong></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Fifth-Harmony1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5141" title="Fifth-Harmony" src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Fifth-Harmony1.png" alt="" width="350" height="622" /></a></p> <p>If you’ve secretly wanted to become a Harmonizer forever but didn’t know where to go, here’s your chance. Check-in to Fifth Harmony’s Jam page to share your Kik username with other Harmonizers. Chat about your fave band member, share performance pics, or plan a concert meetup.</p> <p><strong>3. Halsey</strong></p> <p><center><a href="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tour-dates.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5142" title="tour-dates" src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tour-dates.png" alt="" width="350" height="622" /></a></center>First she took Lollapalooza by storm, now she’s on her own tour for her debut album, Badlands. Check Jam for Halsey’s latest music videos and tour dates. If you add your username to the Halsey chat page, you might even get to talk to the fans who got matching tattoos with the singer.</p> <p><strong>4. Shawn Mendes</strong></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shawn-mendes.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5143" title="shawn-mendes" src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shawn-mendes.png" alt="" width="350" height="622" /></a></p> <p>If “Stitches” is your summer song, head over to Shawn Mendes’ page. You can find other fans who have memorized the music video’s entire choreography, AND you can buy Shawn Mendes merch.</p> <p><strong>5. 5 Seconds of Summer<span style="text-align: center;"> </span></strong></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5sos.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5144" title="5sos" src="http://blog.kik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5sos.png" alt="" width="350" height="622" /></a></p> <p>Looking for new friends who are also obsessed with 5 Seconds of Summer (and can’t wait for the release of their next album)? 5SOS’s chat page on Jam is the place to find them – and to have an in-depth discussion about what “She’s Kinda Hot” really means.</p>

out a pilot of Jam, a chat-based music community built around the world’s best bands and artists. The initial distribution will be limited to a few hundred thousand people so we can see what works, what doesn’t, and what to work on next.</p> <p dir="ltr">We expect the service to change over time, but users will already find plenty to keep them interested. Fans can find profiles of their favorite artists by searching for their names on the homepage of the Jam site. Each profile functions as a Kik site that can be shared with friends. The sites host photos, videos, artist bios, and links to buy merchandise and tickets to upcoming shows.</p> <p dir="ltr">What we love most about this first iteration about Jam, though, is that it offers a simple way to meet new friends based on similar music interests. After all, the only thing better than listening to music is talking about it. People can “check in” to an artist profile and allow others to see that they’re down to chat. This feature demonstrates Kik’s belief that the ultimate network is one built around sharing and connecting.</p> <p dir="ltr">Jam was inspired, in part, by the success of a similar project we ran for <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/one-direction-unveils-best-kik-campaign-ever-154164">One Direction</a> in 2013, where 1.3 million people checked in to the band’s Kik profile. In that case, the site was publicized for only a limited time, but we found that fans were still checking in to the site even 18 months after the campaign ended.</p> <p>Clearly, Kik users love music, and there’s never been a better place to share that passion with friends, old and new alike. We’re excited for what’s ahead. Stay tuned.</p>
